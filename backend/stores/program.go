// a count is blind to repeats and out-of-order logging, silently desyncing
// "today's workout" from what was actually done. The due day is the next workout
// day after the last-logged one in cycle order, wrapping to the first workout day

// follows THAT day — no "remaining incomplete days" bookkeeping, by design.

// that predate day tracking — can't anchor, but each one newer than the anchor still
// ADVANCES the tracker by one workout day, count-based: without that fallback a user
// on an older app build would log forever while the due day stayed parked, a
// regression from the pre-linkage COUNT-based algorithm which advanced on every
// workout. The exception is rows marked program_day_dropped (their day was
// deliberately deleted — or toggled into a rest day — by a routine edit): their
// cycle position is unknowable, and counting them as advances would let one edit
// swing the due day by the parity of an arbitrary lifetime count — deleting or
// rest-toggling a day with 50 logged workouts must not make "today's workout"
// depend on 50 mod cycle length. Dropped rows are ignored entirely. No qualifying

// exercises/sets are still replaced wholesale: nothing persists a reference to them
